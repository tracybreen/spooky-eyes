# Spooky Eyes
This is a small but delightful little program for a web page in which two eyes follow the user's mouse movements in real time. The base code was written by MITxPro staff, and completed by me as an assignment for the following course: [Professional Certificate in Coding: Women's Cohort](https://executive-ed.xpro.mit.edu/professional-certificate-coding-womens-cohort).

## How to Run
To run this program, simply load the index.html file in your browser. Once it has loaded, the eyes on the screen will follow the movements of your mouse around the screen.

## Roadmap of Future Improvements
Enhance the design of the eyes so that they're a little more interesting stylistically.

Add code to follow the mouse when it is directly between the eyes (creating a cross-eyed look).
